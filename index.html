        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
             skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, 
             discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, 
             however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings 
             and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational.
             The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

          <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major 
        “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues,
        it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment,
        waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored,
         not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible.
         For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students 
         actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop 
         thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.</p>

          <p class="sectionTag text-big">Technology in developing in India</p>
          <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in
               impoverished areas and developing countries. However, lack of technological advancement is still causing barriers with regards to quality
                and access to education in developing countries.[54] Charities like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures 
                through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials. The OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by 
                several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. 
                The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.In Africa,
                 the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has launched an "e-school program" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools 
                 with computer equipment, learning materials and internet access within 10 years.[55]
                  An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,[56] started with the support of former American President Bill Clinton,
                   uses the Internet to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.</p>
